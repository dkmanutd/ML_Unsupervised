# ML_Unsupervised

School: Hult International Business School
Course: Machine Learning (DAT-5303)
Assignment: Timed Unsupervised Machine Learning Project (Team)


This will be a timed assignment and teams will be given 3 hours to complete it.

The team's goal in this assignment is to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data. This will require an ability to analyze data using Principle Component Anakysis (PCA) and Clustering, code unsupervised machine learning algorithms and interpret their results.


Case Information

Windows or Mac?

Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.

Recently, Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, your team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors. Apple is looking forward to receiving your key insights, as well as an organized Jupyter Notebook that can be shared with their internal analytical teams. They also have sent you a kind reminder to utilize external research to support your findings and to give details related to details such as audience size.


Data

Survey data has been provided via the assignment link. Assume this data, including its demographics, are representative of the population Apple is attempting to study.
